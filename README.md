## Filters
XPath, JSONPath and CSS support comes baked in! You can be as specific as you need, use XPath exported from various XPath element query creation tools.

(We support LXML re:test, re:math and re:replace.)

## Notifications

ChangeDetection.io supports a massive amount of notifications (including email, office365, custom APIs, etc) when a web-page has a change detected thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/caronc/apprise">apprise</a> library.
Simply set one or more notification URL's in the _[edit]_ tab of that watch.

Just some examples

    discord://webhook_id/webhook_token
    flock://app_token/g:channel_id
    gitter://token/room
    gchat://workspace/key/token
    msteams://TokenA/TokenB/TokenC/
    o365://TenantID:AccountEmail/ClientID/ClientSecret/TargetEmail
    rocket://user:password@hostname/#Channel
    mailto://user:pass@example.com?to=receivingAddress@example.com
    json://someserver.com/custom-api
    syslog://
 
<a href="https://github.com/caronc/apprise#popular-notification-services">And everything else in this list!</a>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/screenshot-notifications.png" style="max-width:100%;" alt="Self-hosted web page change monitoring notifications"  title="Self-hosted web page change monitoring notifications"  />

Now you can also customise your notification content!

## JSON API Monitoring

Detect changes and monitor data in JSON API's by using the built-in JSONPath selectors as a filter / selector.

This will re-parse the JSON and apply formatting to the text, making it super easy to monitor and detect changes in JSON API results

### Parse JSON embedded in HTML!

When you enable a `json:` filter, you can even automatically extract and parse embedded JSON inside a HTML page! Amazingly handy for sites that build content based on JSON, such as many e-commerce websites. 

```
<html>
...
<script type="application/ld+json">
  {"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Product","name":"Nan Optipro Stage 1 Baby Formula  800g","price": 23.50 }
</script>
```  

`json:$.price` would give `23.50`, or you can extract the whole structure
